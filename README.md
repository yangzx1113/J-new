The J-new folder contains the code for the J-new method and the compiled file.

The NuWLS-c folder contains the NuWLS-c solver,the compiled J-new, and script.

Here, NuWLS-c has been modified to use the initial assignment obtained by J-new as input.

Run `./nuwlspre.sh` to execute NuWLS-c with the J-new.

Just pay attention to modifying the path of the benchmark in the script.
